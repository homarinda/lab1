	Tips to write an inspiring “About Me Page”
Before creating an About Me, you should know exactly what is the purpose of this page and where are you writing it. Following are a few tips to help you in making “About Me Page” for your blog/website which will look more impressive and attractive.

Remember people want to know who you are, so be original, honest and open about yourself. Readers love it when you reveal the negativity in your personality along with positivity.
You can also tell some inspiring story from your life experiences. A story may possess more power to hold a reader’s attention than general information.
Don’t create very long About Me pages. The readers avoid the pages that hold long and detailed content. So the moment it starts to get boring and uninteresting, write the ending lines.
An inspiring About Me page should not only look good but also it should serve the purpose of its creation.
Be considerate about the colors and styles you use. Quick leaps from bold colors to soft ones or different styles can leave a poor impression on the reader.
Put some impressive academic or experimental stuff. To create an inspiring About Me page, you need to show your genius side to the readers.
Make sure that you use clear words in your sentences. If your page holds any confusion or ambiguity, the readers might prefer leaving it.
Use your favorite quote or saying and tell the readers how it inspired you. It is a great way to communicate and make a connection with readers.
Save a little space for “About You”. Tell the readers what you expect and what you wish to do with their help.
Make sure that the theme, color combination, and design of your page is getting along with your written information.
